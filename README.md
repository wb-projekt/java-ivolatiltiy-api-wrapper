# TODO
* <span style="color: red;">This code does not have the re-try yet.</span>
* <span style="color: yellow;">This code has not been tested with a real API yet, just a Wiremock mock, cos I have not registered for their trial yet.</span>
* It does not re-use http connections, we should add that to improve performance.
* It does not have the error handling nor full test coverage, happy to add all of that once we start working.
* Also, happy to adjust code style to what you see would make more sense for your company.
* Also, happy to remove code duplication once we have all the classes in place to keep the code highly cohesive and loosely coupled.
